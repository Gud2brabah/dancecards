  <li>Modified and updated for UKHB 2022 by Del Merritt to meet privacy requests and lanyard-color coordination needs; implemented access via QR code</li>
  <li>Further modified and updated for AHB 2022 by Del Merritt to add photos in the "send sticker" form</li>
  <li>Further modified and updated for NEHB 2022 by Del Merritt, with input from Peter Milan, to add collapsing voice sections, to-sing count, improve post-sticker viewing, and self-service for uploading photo and/or indicating attempt at Super Tramp</li>
  <li>Further modified and updated for UKHB, MHBNE, AHB, and NEHB 2023 by Del Merritt to enhance tramp reporting.</li>
  <li>Further modified and updated for NCHB 2024 by Ross Wilkins. Set a more
  contrasting color for blinking blocks to make them stand out more, and added
  "invisible" h4 header tags to ease navigation for visually-impaired attendees</li>
